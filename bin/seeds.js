    description: `Harley-Davidson formally announced a number of new motorcycles, including this upright naked-style streetbike. Dubbed a streetfighter, The Motor Company says this prototype will make its way to production for the 2020 model year. The engine is a version of Harley’s new multi-purpose water-cooled V-twin that powers both the Pan America adventure-bike and the company's new roadster-looking custom, only smaller, with an 975cc capacity according to Harley. Similarly to the other three models, the engine appears to employ a 60-degree vee with large cylinder heads hide a pair of double overhead camshafts. This will help give the necessary power and performance that a modern naked bike needs to compete in this red-hot segment. A low-mounted slash-cut exhaust looks tough and sounds the part, too, based on what we heard during Harley-Davidson’s promotional video. The tubular steel frame also appears similar to the custom/roadster unit, but the streetfighter gets a stubbier and more rigid-looking swingarm, most likely to boost maneuverability and rear grip during fast-paced rides. The prototype rolls on conventionally sized (within the class) 17-inch spoke alloy wheels shod in Michelin’s older-style Pilot Power 2CT rubber, in traditional sizes (120/70-17 front, 180/55-17 rear).`,
